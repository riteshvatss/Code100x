Code100x -  Coding Platform
Code100x is a fully functional web-based coding platform where users can log in, write code in multiple programming languages, and execute it. This platform offers a complete environment for users to practice coding, run test cases, and track their performance.

Key Features
Multi-Language Support:
Users can write code in various programming languages and run their programs directly on the platform.

Real-Time Code Execution with Judge0 API:
The platform integrates with the Judge0 API, which compiles and executes the user's code. Users can run their code and receive real-time feedback on test case results.

Input and Output Validation:
The platform has two folders â€” one for input data and one for expected output. When a user submits their code, the output generated by the Judge0 API is compared with the expected output to validate the correctness of the code.

Optimized Performance with Webhooks:
Since Judge0 API runs test cases in a queue, it might take time to complete all test executions. To reduce latency, we implemented webhooks. The webhook notifies our backend about the status of test cases, improving overall performance and responsiveness.

PostgreSQL Database for Performance Tracking:
We use PostgreSQL to store and manage users' performance data, including their test results, submission history, and overall progress.
